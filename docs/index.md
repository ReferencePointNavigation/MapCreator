# Reference Point Navigation Map Builder Plugin

## Installation

The current release of the plugin can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ReferencePointNavigation/MapCreator/releases).

## The Map

The `.rpn` files generated by the Map Builder Plugin are a standard [`.zip`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) file which contains the map data in serialized protobuf format. Full documentation of the protocol buffer definitions can be found [here](proto.md)

### Map file contents

- The `.map` file corresponds to the [Map.proto](proto.md#map) definition. This is the "index" of all of the other objects (Buildings, Paths etc.) in the `.rpn` file. Clients should extract this file first and use the `buildings` field to extract the required buildings as needed. This greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to be deserialized and loaded into memory.

- The `.bldg` file corresponds to the [Building.proto](proto.md#building) definiton.
