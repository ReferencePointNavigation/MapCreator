# Reference Point Navigation Map Builder Plugin

The current release of the plugin can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ReferencePointNavigation/MapCreator/releases)



## The Map

The `.rpn` files generated by the Map Builder Plugin are a standard `.zip` file which contains the map data in serialized protobuf format.

### Map file contents

- The `.map` file corresponds to the [Map.proto](https://github.com/ReferencePointNavigation/protobuf/blob/69a73dae59fd79c5f41d1ea8a28f5acc8b95e608/Map.proto) definition. This is the "index" of all of the other objects (Buildings, Paths etc.) in the `.rpn` file. Clients should extract this file first and use the `buildings` field to extract the required buildings as needed. This will greatly reduce the amount of data that needs to be deserialized and loaded into memory.

- The `.bldg` file corresponds to the [Building.proto](https://github.com/ReferencePointNavigation/protobuf/blob/69a73dae59fd79c5f41d1ea8a28f5acc8b95e608/Building.proto) definiton.
